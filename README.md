The software involved an online version of the game Win, Lose or Draw. This type of software runs through a browser. While laying out the documentation, I feel I did a decent job of consisely explaining how different operating systems can deal with server and client programs, showing the benefits and downsides to each. Working through a design document helped me create more focused and organized code, as well as prevent me from adding unnessessary things to the program. If I had to improve something from my document, it would be the reccomended section, as perhaps I could explain the sections a bit more in detail. I implemented the users needs by not understanding what they asked for, but rather what I feel they actually want. A customer may not know how to explain what they actually want, so it is a developers job to interpret their requests deeper than face value. I approached the software design process by only programming what I needed to. This ensures optimized and understandable code designed so that a team of people can work on it with little communication outside the code itself.
